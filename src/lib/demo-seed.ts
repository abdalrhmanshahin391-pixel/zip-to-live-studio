    stem: "A 58-year-old man has 40 minutes of crushing central chest pain radiating to the left arm, with sweating and nausea. ECG shows 3 mm ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF. Which artery is most likely occluded?",
    options: [
      { letter: "A", body: "Left anterior descending artery", is_correct: false, wrong_reason: "The LAD supplies the anterior wall and septum, so occlusion gives ST elevation in V1–V4, not in the inferior leads." },
      { letter: "B", body: "Right coronary artery", is_correct: true, wrong_reason: "" },
      { letter: "C", body: "Left circumflex artery", is_correct: false, wrong_reason: "The circumflex supplies the lateral wall (I, aVL, V5–V6). It causes inferior changes only in the 15–20% of people with a left-dominant circulation, which is not the default answer." },
      { letter: "D", body: "Left main stem", is_correct: false, wrong_reason: "Left main occlusion causes widespread ST depression with aVR elevation and profound shock, not isolated inferior elevation." },

    correct_explanation:
      "Concept — In a STEMI the ECG lead group that shows ST elevation maps directly onto the wall of the heart that is losing its blood supply, and each wall has a dominant supplying artery. Leads II, III and aVF look at the inferior wall, which in roughly 80% of people is supplied by the right coronary artery (right-dominant circulation).\n\nWhy this answer is right — Inferior ST elevation (II, III, aVF) with a typical ischaemic history is the textbook picture of an acute right coronary artery occlusion. Supporting clues you would look for: ST elevation taller in III than in II, reciprocal ST depression in I and aVL, and bradycardia or heart block because the RCA usually feeds the SA and AV nodes. Right-sided leads (V4R) may show elevation if the right ventricle is involved, which matters because those patients are preload-dependent and can crash with nitrates.\n\nWhy the others are wrong — LAD occlusion gives anterior/septal elevation (V1–V4) and often a bigger drop in ejection fraction. Circumflex occlusion gives lateral changes (I, aVL, V5–V6) and is the inferior culprit only in a left-dominant heart. Left main occlusion presents with diffuse ST depression, aVR elevation and cardiogenic shock.\n\nSummary — Inferior leads (II, III, aVF) → inferior wall → right coronary artery in most patients; check for bradyarrhythmia and right ventricular involvement before giving nitrates.",

      { letter: "B", body: "Creatine kinase MB", is_correct: false, wrong_reason: "CK-MB is useful but less specific — it is also released by skeletal muscle — and it is mainly kept for detecting re-infarction because it clears within 48–72 h." },

    ],
    correct_explanation:
      "Concept — Necrotic myocytes leak structural proteins into the blood; the diagnostic value of each protein depends on how exclusive it is to heart muscle and how fast it appears.\n\nWhy this answer is right — Cardiac troponin I (and T) are isoforms found essentially only in cardiac myocytes. They start rising 3–4 hours after injury, so by 6 hours a high-sensitivity assay is both sensitive and specific, and the rise-and-fall pattern on serial sampling confirms an acute event.\n\nWhy the others are wrong — CK-MB overlaps with skeletal muscle and is now reserved for suspected re-infarction. Myoglobin is fast but shared by all muscle. LDH is late and non-specific.\n\nSummary — Six hours in, troponin is the test; use serial values to show the rise and fall.",

    correct_explanation:
      "Concept — STEMI is a totally occluded epicardial artery: the whole treatment is to open it as fast as possible, and the choice between PCI and lysis is decided by the expected delay.\n\nWhy this answer is right — Guidelines favour primary PCI whenever the first-medical-contact-to-balloon time can be kept under roughly 120 minutes. At 90 minutes the patient is inside that window, and PCI restores flow more reliably than lysis with a much lower intracranial bleed risk.\n\nWhy the others are wrong — Lysis is only preferred outside the window; a 72-hour plan abandons salvageable myocardium; stress testing is unsafe and irrelevant here.\n\nSummary — PCI within ~120 minutes wins; fibrinolysis only when it does not.",

They sit alongside ACE inhibitors/ARNI, MRAs and SGLT2 inhibitors as the four pillars of therapy.\n\nWhy the others are wrong — Diuretics treat symptoms, calcium channel blockers can harm, digoxin only cuts admissions.\n\nSummary — Symptoms: diuretics.
